This simple repository was created for an internship project.

In this inventory management project i have created an inventory (dataset) of sales of some products in a particular shop.

Features of this project are as following:-

	>>> Updating and adding new products to database.
	
	>>> Shoping like purchasing item from inventory.
	
	>>> Using 3 dimentional dictonary for better accessibility and making single purchase invoice for one person.
	In this, with help of 3D dictonary a single purchase invoice is generated and that can get multiple products in one transaction.
